# Powershell-Customization
My customization of my powershell terminal

# Getting Started
Open up powershell terminal on your computer

# Step 1 -- Fonts
To get started, download the jetBrains font from nerd font: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/tag/v3.2.1

Go to the zipped folder, click extract, and then select all the extracted files and click install.

Boot up your powershell terminal, navigate to settings, and then navigate to defaults.

Find Font Face, and then select jetBrains mono.

# Step 2 -- Color Scheme
To get started, navigate to this page: https://windowsterminalthemes.dev/

Keep pressing "next" until you get to Dracula+.

Select the color scheme Dracula+, and then click on get theme.

Navigate back to the powershell terminal, go to settings and click "Open JSON File".

After opening the JSON File, scroll to schemes, and navigate to the end of it. Make sure to add a comma at the end of the bracket.

Paste the color scheme in there, and presss ctrl S to save.

Restart settings, and the theme should be an available option to select.

# Step 3 -- OH MY POSH!

To get started, visit this website: https://ohmyposh.dev/docs

Go to installation, go to the system you are on and follow the page. They tell you everything and every command you need to execute.

After you are done with installation, navigate to the "prompt" section, and follow the instructions.

Open up your custom profile, and copy paste my configs in there, change the theme path to whatever your theme path is, and your posh theme is all set up!

# Step 4 -- Optional Configs

Navigate to settings > defaults, and go to background image, set the transparency to 20%.

This set up is good for pictures with grey backgrounds, however, you can set up your background however you like. :D
